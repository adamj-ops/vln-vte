# Mobile Sidebar Fix - Summary

## Problem
The right sidebar navigation menu on the Communication Pearls page was completely hidden on mobile devices (screens < 1024px width). The sidebar had `display: none` by default and only appeared on desktop screens.

## Solution
Modified the CSS to make the sidebar responsive and mobile-friendly without negatively impacting mobile functionality:

### Mobile View (< 1024px)
- **Changed from:** Hidden (`display: none`)
- **Changed to:** Horizontal scrollable menu
- **Features:**
  - Displays as a horizontal scrollable row at the top of the content
  - Semi-transparent purple background with blur effect for visual consistency
  - Touch-friendly scrolling with smooth momentum
  - Compact button styling (smaller font, padding, rounded corners)
  - Visual fade indicator on the right edge to show more content is available
  - Thin scrollbar for better UX
  - Positioned above the main content using CSS Grid

### Desktop View (≥ 1024px)
- **No changes:** Maintains original fixed sidebar layout
- All desktop functionality preserved
